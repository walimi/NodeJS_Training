10_01 - Testing with Mocha and Chai
------------------------------------

### Install the Mocha testing framework globally using the following command

* `sudo npm install mocha -g` 

(You not need the sudo command in a Mac environment.)

To run Mocha type `mocha` in the command line

With Mocha you place the test files under the test folder.  

### Install Chai using the following npm command

* `npm install chai --save-dev`

Chai is the assertion engine.
